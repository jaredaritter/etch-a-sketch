# Etch-a-Sketch

## Mouseover etch-a-sketch with user prompted grid size
* New Grid - resets grid and allows choice in side length of grid in number of cells
* Silver - toggles between default color of teal when off and silver when on
* Random - each generates random rgb for each cell on mouseover
* Lighten - decreases cell opacity by 0.1 on mouseover with minimum of 1

## Work in progress with future updates in functionality and styling
